            My job as a Software Engineering Intern involved working on a variety of projects. <br>
            The first project I had worked on had to do with on-line traffic, the traffic that comes in needs to be filtered for authenticity from artificial traffic to ensure quality of our product. <br>
            I was tasked with rewriting the existing tool with a new aggregation system. <br>
            This involved looking onto different aggregation methods and services and aggregating the new data onto AWS's S3, along with this was fixing rendering problems and using Athena to run queries on the data gathered from the traffic to use towards the services ADknown offers to customers
