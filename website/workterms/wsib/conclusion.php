    &nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience at WSIB Innovation Lab, ive been able to listen to many different talks from being able to go to True North, and different meetings and workshops which are things that will continue with me.
I have also learned that working in a governemnt mandated business, is a very slow and non demanding work place. Apart from a few different projects the drive or desire to work and learn forward felt low, 
shortly after the research process was completed, and many iterations take place with little results. I am glad i got to work with Masonry Strain sensors because i feel like it's something applicable and helpful, 
but time will tell when it sees the light of day.</p>
