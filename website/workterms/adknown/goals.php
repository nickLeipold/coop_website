<h4>Have a greater understanding of web development</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my work experience at ADknown I was immersed in way more web than I even knew existed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I now know how most sites pass data and the transfer of information, and the information that is gathered on the web.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still much to learn such as frameworks and new and better languages but I have now been opened to all the different opportunities and possibilities.

<h4>Better learn how to self manage</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have worked on this goal to increase productivity in the tasks I am given, and have become better at estimating the time it takes me to complete a project.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Always more room for improvement here and I will continue to work on it.
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h4>Improve verbal and written communication skills</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Goal has been worked on and improved from a larger understanding of specific tools and vocabulary in the field.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication through text (Slack) and verbal communication has become more productive and concise to the point where the question is answered and can get back to work.
</div>

<div>
<h4>Work to understand concepts and take constructive criticism as an opportunity</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a very new thing for me as I have never really encountered reviews, and in my previous experiences when I had a review I was supposed to defend my position.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That way of thinking i had to unlearn and realize that review in computer science is meant to be constructive and to improve your capabilities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have improved in this area quite a bit but some things that i get too passionate in i still get defensive, which I will continue to work on and grow through as a developer.

<h4>Better adapt to different styles of managers and colleagues</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a good goal I came upon while working at ADknown where I was working very well with some managers and not so well with others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was I was treating communication with all managers as the same, which I had not taken into account, that it does not work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From writing down some notes and taking some more time to realize what each manager enjoys I have been able to work more efficiently with each manager and each party is happier after our interactions.
