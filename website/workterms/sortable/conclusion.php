    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the conclusion I am pulling from my experience at ADknown, from the experiences I've
    gained and all the different things I have learned.<br>
    During my 8 month term at ADknown I started with very little experience and knowledge about web development.<br>
    The learning curve was very steep but they stuck with me till I came up to speed where i learned a plethora of
    different tools.<br>
    During this term I learned PHP for the use in all of their web tools, JS for gathering browser information, SQL for
    analysis all of the big data that we gather <br>and a bunch of Amazon Web Services Including S3, Athena and EC2 to
    name a few that i have learned.<br>
    All of the above and so much more have set me up to be a better employee, and better adapt to situations and
    employers.<br>
    I could not ask for a better group of people to pressure me to learn new content, and help me along the way to grow
    as a programmer and learn how to properly design new projects.<br>
    They were all FANTASTIC , and i hope to continue meeting more great people in my en-devours.<br>Would recommend to
    anyone who wants a challenge and to learn many many new things.
