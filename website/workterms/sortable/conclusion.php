    &nbsp;&nbsp;From my experiences at Sortable, I've gained new skills and views at the problems I encounter from day to day in programming.
        Along this 4 month journey I had the pleasure of working with some of the most diverse group of personalities and people with varying ranges of expertise and knowledge.
        Was able to work alongside some people with great knowledge in the company and also had the luxury to relax and talk to co-workers over some cocktails fridays and over some beers at other social events,
        Which is something I don't believe I really experienced anywhere else, I really felt like part of the team.
    Sortable is a group of caring, level headed people who will help you with new topics and understand the challenges you are facing,
        which is why my co-op experience was successful and I would recommend to other people to join the team.</p>
